# docker-xpra java applets
This is a Docker image to run a virtual window (framebuffer) which is controlled remotely with xpra with xterm installed.

The major advantage of xpra is that you can access application windows instead of an entire desktop making it very performant.

# dockerhub build status

Steps to use these images:

    docker run -p 14500:14500 --name xpra -d samyco/xpra:java-applet

this will start a container that is accessible via tcp, the fastest but most unsecure method

A password is autogenerated, to view execute:

    docker logs xpra
